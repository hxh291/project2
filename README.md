# project2

#4 For step 4, the simple script of day, calendar, ls and pwd, I had to use nano task.sh instead of the tutorials vi. Also,cal does not work in Gitbash, but task.sh is now a script.

#9 Created the Hello World Script using the default method in the tutorial. I tried the alternative approach, but found that it erased my previous script. It was good practice to recreate the script again though. Created the file by "nano hello-world.sh" Used a shebang to define the interpreter as bash on the first line, line 3 "echo "hello world", then saved. Made the file executable by chmod +x hello-world.sh.

#10 "man" command does not work in GitBash. I had to change the directory to where my backup script was located using cd~ and then making a new folder. The default folder for my projects was my "users" folder, which is around 30GB! 

#11 Created the welcome script. Very fun, although very simple. Simply used the previous steps to create a script, by using "nano welcome.sh" Then inputting the proper instructions from the tutorial. At first, I thought (Whoami) was just entering my own name but found out that its actually a command that gathers the name of your Computer! Changed the error to reflect the correct name.
